1) npm test - to run the tests
2) allure serve - to see results


Founded bugs:
-Script crashing with using numbers in firstName\lastName fields (example - with 'asd4' in firstName field), thats why negative cases
for this fields are disabled.

-Script crashing with using symbols in email field (example - with '%$@gmail.com'), thats why negative cases for this field is 
disabled.

You can run tests without enabling it to approve that it works and then try to enable this parts when bugs will be fixed
